# kyphosis-dtree

### Applying Decision Tree model on Kyphosis data set, and get confusion matrix, accuracy and precision. 
An incresed front-to-back curve of the upper spine is called as kyphosis.

### Finding parameters-
<code>classification_report</code> <br>
<code>accuracy_score </code><br>
<code>precision_score </code><br>
<code>recall_score</code><br>
<code>f1_score,matthews_corrcoef</code><br>

### Decision Tree-
With diffrent depth level and entropy type
